									<p>
										Unreal Magic is a First person shooter game in which the player can control metallic objects to mentally push or pull them or himself<br/>
										Me and two other friends made this project with two goals in mind, learning how to use Unreal Engine blueprints and making a prototype of how the powers
										described in the Mistborn book series by Brandon Sanderson would work in a videogame.<br/>
										I worked both as a programmer and as a game designer in this project. <br/>
										Almost all assets are placeholders because we wanted to focus on learning the engine rather than making something pretty
